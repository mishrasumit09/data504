The linear model for predicting asset-poverty from literacy rate in India is

The ``hat" is used to signify that this is an estimate.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{An objective measure for finding the best line}

\begin{itemize}

\item We want a line that has small residuals:
\pause
\begin{enumerate}
\item Option 1: Minimize the sum of magnitudes (absolute values) of residuals
\[ |e_1| + |e_2| + \cdots + |e_n| \]
\pause
\item Option 2: Minimize the sum of squared residuals -- \hl{least squares}
\[ e_1^2 + e_2^2 + \cdots + e_n^2 \]
\end{enumerate}

\pause

\item Why least squares?
\pause
\begin{enumerate}
\item Most commonly used
\pause
\item Easier to compute by hand and using software
\pause
\item In many applications, a residual twice as large as another is usually more than twice as bad

\item For each \% point decrease in literacy rate, \% living in poverty is expected to increase on average by 61.9\%.

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Recap}

\begin{itemize}

\item Inference for the slope for a single-predictor linear regression model:
\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item Hypothesis test:
\[ T = \frac{b_1 - null~value}{SE_{b_1}} \qquad df = n - 2 \]
\pause
\item Confidence interval:
\[ b_1 \pm t^\star_{df = n - 2} SE_{b_1} \]
\end{itemize}

\pause

\item The null value is often 0 since we are usually checking for \hl{any} relationship between the explanatory and the response variable.

\pause

\item The regression output gives $b_1$, $SE_{b_1}$, and \hl{two-tailed} p-value for the $t$-test for the slope where the null value is 0.

\pause

\item We rarely do inference on the intercept, so we'll be focusing on the estimates and inference for the slope.

\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Caution}

\begin{itemize}

\item Always be aware of the type of data you're working with: random sample, non-random sample, or population.

\pause

\item Statistical inference, and the resulting p-values, are meaningless when you already have population data.

\pause

\item If you have a sample that is non-random (biased), inference on the results will be unreliable.

\pause

\item The ultimate goal is to have independent observations.

\end{itemize}
